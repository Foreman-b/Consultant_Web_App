# Consultant Booking Web Application

A role-based Django web application that allows clients to book sessions with a consultant.  
The platform supports authentication, structured booking management, and role-controlled dashboards for both clients and consultants.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This system is designed as a single-consultant booking platform where:

- Users register as **clients** by default  
- Admin assigns **consultant** role  
- Clients can book sessions with a reason for consultation  
- Consultant reviews bookings, confirms status, and provides a meeting link  
- Both users access dedicated dashboards  

The application follows Django’s MVT architecture and enforces clean role-based access control.
